Selection Sort Explanation:
This algorithm starts at the first number in the list and checks each number after that to find the lowest number. Then it takes the current number and makes it switch places with the lowest number. It will continue to do this until it hits the end of the list.

Best Case Scenario:
The numbers in the list are already in order so that no switching is needed.

Worst Case Scenario:
None of the numbers in the list are in the correct ordering position. The algorithm would have to swap numbers every step along on the way.
